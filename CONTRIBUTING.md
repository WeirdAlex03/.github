# How to contribute

## Reporting bugs/issues

If you encounter any problems, report them with an issue:

- First, search issues to see if your problem has already been reported
- If your problem is new, open an issue. Please be as descriptive as possible;
  explain exactly how you encountered the problem so it can be reproduced.
- If there is already an open issue, you may also describe how you encountered
  the problem if it differs from others. Otherwise, nothing is required from you.
- If there was an issue but it was closed, open a new issue as described above
  and reference the old issue by typing `#` and the number, for example, `#12`
  for issue 12.

## Contributing code

I am not actively looking for help writing code, but I will probably appreciate
it. If you would like to contribute code, please first reach out by
[joining my Discord server](https://discord.gg/72qa2YJZxY) or DMing me directly
at WeirdAlex03#5049. If your contribution fixes an issue, you can also leave a
comment on that issue.

## General feedback

If you have any general feedback you'd like to suggest, that would be greatly appreciated!
Please [join my Discord server](https://discord.gg/72qa2YJZxY) or DM me directly
at WeirdAlex03#5049 to get in touch.
